				<p>
					Deman Drawkcab is not your average cup of tea. He is slightly different to the established homo-sapien. Not utterly different but by no means run-of-the-mill.
				</p>
				<p>
					For example: Yesterday, Deman had just crossed through Green Park and was now walking up Piccadilly (a road in London). He stopped outside the Ritz (a well known hotel), on his way to a Police station. I should point out he wasn't going there to help out, he was in trouble, but I'll get to that later. Anyway, he was outside the Ritz, waiting to cross the road. The traffic lights to his right had, from his thinking, obviously turned red as the oncoming traffic had stopped, so he began to cross.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now the thing about these lights outside the Ritz is; they have a lovely pedestrian crossing marked on the road, but there is no, nice, green man available to suggest when to cross. Deman presumed it was good to go, as the traffic to his right had stopped and he only needed to make it to the central road reservation after all. But unfortunately the traffic had only stopped to let the vehicles from the junction in front of him out! This traffic roared from the junction, full of lorries, vans and taxis, eager to get where they need to be. It was too late for Deman to turn back now, he was half way across, a white van in the inside lane accelerated towards him fast...
				</p>

				<p>
					Sorry to stop at this rather inconvenient moment but I think I may have to fill you in with a few details. Deman Drawkcab is an odd looking man. He is tall, well built, but not visibly muscular, a large build, but not fat. He has a strange mullet hair cut which looks as if it was styled in the 1970's, he gives off the impression of being a bit simple and slow, like a man you wouldn't want to sit next to on the bus for fear you have no idea what he might do next. An inbred appearance might be cruel but the efficient way to describe him.
				</p>
				<p>
					Deman is very antisocial, he has no friends and only really talks in grunts, mainly due to laziness, he could probably hold a meaningful conversation, but anyone is yet to find out. His appearance is deceptive, not in the way you might think, for he is incredibly unfit and very easily gets out of breath, merely walking causes him suitable discomfort.
				</p>
			</page>
			<page id="page4" class="relative p-t-2 p-x-2 p-b-1 m-b-3">
				<p>
					He knows he is different, his parents were similar. He has noticed that with every generation the Drawkcab's were getting more and more different from the last, further from the norm, and different in quite an extraordinary way. With each member born into the family’s bloodline, their build has become slightly more bulkier than an average person, but that's pretty insignificant by all accounts. The strange thing is that their appearance doesn't really reflect their biggest difference.
				</p>
				<p>
					Unfortunately Deman has not been able to find any scales strong enough to way himself. Which gives you a clue to his unconventional characteristic. His mum being the curious type: A tall, voluptuous, but not obese, lady. Once had access to a weigh bridge and found she weighed a mere 6500 kg, around 6.5 tons or 1024 stone, that’s roughly 110 times heavier than you or I. Going by the effect he has on his immediate surroundings and over hearing that his mum was double the weight of his grandmother, Deman guessed that he was in fact double the weight of his mum.
				</p>

			<page id="page5" class="relative p-t-2 p-x-2 p-b-1 m-b-3">
				<p>
					Obviously, being the same weight as a double-decker bus has its disadvantages. That much weight delivered through a relatively small footprint cause some issues. Simple things like; not being able to enjoy a nice day at the beach or a long walk in the park, not being able to enter the majority of shops or buildings for fear that the floor will collapse, not being able to cross many small bridges, drive, ride on public transport or indeed, fly in commercial airliners or any aircraft for that matter.
				</p>
				<p>
					But on the flip side it does have a fair number of advantages. Everything is relative and having all that mass compressed into such a small frame does enable him to lift things easily half his weight, such as a car, making changing a tyre a doddle, not that he needs to do this very often, not being able to drive. Also with this great bulk, compared to an average man he appears to be made of iron or in his case, lead, and fairly indestructible when he comes in contact with things that an average man would ever encounter on a day to day basis. Which leads us nicely back to where I interrupted…

				<p>
					He was almost halfway across the road, a van in the inside lane accelerated towards him. Deman, not being physically fit, hampered by his extreme weight, could not escape the vehicle’s path. Unless this seemingly angry looking van driving noticed Deman and hit the brakes within the next second, there was definitely going to be a nasty accident. The inevitable collision seemed a slow and drawn out process. Deman knew this van would reach him at any second but he seemed pretty relaxed about the whole thing. Time seemed to be almost at a stand still as he watched the state of sheer panic pass onto the driver’s expression. His eye opened wide and fixed on Deman as his open mouth worded some expletives whilst salivating uncontrollably.
				</p>
				<p>
					Deman thought to himself in a very calm, slow and considered manner, “It's not my fault the council didn't make this pedestrian crossing clear enough, is it," and carried on slowly plodding across the road, now looking down at the ground, knowing full well of the situation.
				</p>

			<page id="page7" class="relative p-t-2 p-x-2 p-b-1 m-b-3">
				<p>
					Deman Drawkcab simply stopped, his oversized size 16 shoes creaking as he did so, extra wide shoes that he had specially made for him, to help spread his weight and stop him sinking into the ground.
				</p>
				<p>
					The van driver only had time to hit the horn, he tried to break but couldn't manoeuvre fast enough and “CRUNCH!” he hit the back of Deman's leg, just hitting his heel. The van jolted up into the air as the driver lost control and veered towards the side of the road where an open topped bus was parked. Deman swung around to his left, stretched out his arm as a far as he could reach and grabbed the vans rear bumper, stopping the van almost instantly and pulling Deman to the ground. This caused the ground to shake quite dramatically. The driver, after almost headbutting the steering wheel was seated, motionless, his jaw dropped, staring forwards, wide eyed, open mouthed, at the corner of the bus he narrowly missed. He still had his hand pressed firmly on the horn, clearly in a state of shock and confusion as to what just happen. Some passer-by ran from the kerb to check the van driver was okay, meanwhile Deman got to his feet, shook his head, brushed down his trousers, noticing he had slightly grazed his knee and scuffed his trouser leg. He promptly set off, leaving the van driver to it and carried on with his seemingly long walk to the police station.

				<p>
					It was actually quite a long walk to the station, especially as didn’t like walking much. He did, however, get quite a lot of practice at it, not being able to use many forms of transport.
				</p>
				<p>
					A man he once saved from a near collision wanted to return the favour and made a simple push along scooter for Deman to get around on. It was a massive engineering project and eventually it was designed in a way to withstand the 13 tonne Deman riding it. Unfortunately the small super strength wheels carved deep tracks in the road surface and caused a great deal of damage. He was banned from using it.
				</p>
				<p>
					Deman lives in an old converted train shed in Battersea, near the river. This, he found, was one of a few places with strong enough foundations near the area he grew up in. He liked London for solid floors; the countryside was like quicksand to him when it rained. DD made it habitable himself, most of the internal walls are made of slabs of concrete with the steel rods sticking out and forced into knots, tying together sections of brick wall from demolition sites. Deman makes extra cash by helping out in demolition and the removal of floors, walls and ceilings, it is something he is good at.

						His house is a dank, dingy, mess. There is no paint on the walls apart from the odd bit of graffiti, it is lit by basic lighting recovered from a shop, mould grows in the corners of every other room and everything is reinforced with rusty scaffolding, iron clad or made from concrete, most of the existing train shed windows are boarded up and the only natural light comes from a few transparent panels of tatty plastic corrugated sheets. His heating is provided by a large, rusty, old, riveted iron boiler that looks as though it came from a ship or factory from the early 20th century. He doesn't really have any soft furnishings, a favourite arm chair of his is made from reinforced concrete with a thick rubber back and cork arms, and this is pretty soft to him. His parents made his bed for him when he was about 12. You know, designed and built it, not just tucked in the sheets. It's made from layers of old woven, stretched out tyres with a steel girder frame. He used to hate the smell of sleeping on rubber when he was little but he find it comforting now as it reminds him of his mum and dad.
