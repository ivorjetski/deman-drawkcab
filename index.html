					Deman Drawkcab is not your average cup of tea. He is slightly different to the established homo-sapien. Not utterly different but by no means run-of-the-mill.
				</p>
				<p>
					For example: Yesterday, Deman had just crossed through Green Park and was now walking up Piccadilly (a road in London). He stopped outside the Ritz (a well known hotel), on his way to a Police station. I should point out he wasn't going there to help out, he was in trouble, but I'll get to that later. Anyway, he was outside the Ritz, waiting to cross the road. The traffic lights to his right had, from his thinking, obviously turned red as the oncoming traffic had stopped, so he began to cross.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now the thing about these lights outside the Ritz is; they have a lovely pedestrian crossing marked on the road, but there is no, nice, green man available to suggest when to cross. Deman presumed it was good to go, as the traffic to his right had stopped and he only needed to make it to the central road reservation after all. But unfortunately the traffic had only stopped to let the vehicles from the junction in front on him out! This traffic roared from the junction, full of lorries, vans and taxis, eager to get where they need to be. It was too late for Deman to turn back now, he was half way across, a white van in the inside lane accelerated towards him fast...

					Sorry to stop at this rather inconvenient moment but I think I may have to fill you in with a few details. Deman Drawkcab is an odd looking man. He is tall, well built, but not visibly muscular, a large build, but not fat. He has a strange mullet hair cut which looks as if it was styled in the 1970's, he gives off the impression of being a bit simple and slow, like a man you wouldn't want to sit next to on the bus for fear you have no idea what he might do next. An inbred appearance might be cruel but the efficient way to describe him.
				</p>
				<p>
					Deman is very antisocial, he has no friends and only really talks in grunts, mainly due to laziness, he could probably hold a meaningful conversation, but anyone is yet to find out. His appearance is deceptive, not in the way you might think, for he is incredibly unfit and very easily gets out of breath, merely walking causes him suitable discomfort.

			He knows he is different, his parents were similar. He has noticed that with every generation the Drawkcab's were getting more and more different from the last, further from the norm, different in quite an extraordinary way. Their build has become slightly bulkier than an average person with every birth, but that's pretty insignificant, the strange thing is that their appearance doesn't really reflect their actual weight. Unfortunately Deman has not been able to find any scales strong enough to way himself which gives you a clue to his unconventional characteristic. His mum being the curious type, a tall, voluptuous lady, but not fat, once had access to a weigh bridge and found she weighed a mere 9120 kg, around 10 tons or 1436 stone, depending on how you work. Deman is guessing that he is double this, going by the effect he has on the surrounding landscape and knowing that his mum was double the weight of his grandmother.
		</p>

		<p>
			Being the same weight as a double-decker bus has it's disadvantages; not being able to enjoy a nice day at the beach or a long walk in the park, not being able to enter most shops or buildings for fear that the floor will collapse, not being able to cross many small bridges, drive, ride public transport or catch aeroplanes. But it does have a fair number of advantages. Everything is relative and having all that mass compressed into such a small frame does enable him to lift things easily half his weight, such as a car, making changing a tyre a doddle, not that he needs to do this very often. Also with this great bulk, compared to an average man he appears to be made of iron or in his case lead and fairly indestructible when he comes in contact with things that an average man would ever encounter on a day to day basis.
